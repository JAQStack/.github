## 🧩 What Is JAQ Stack?

**JAQ Stack** (Java + Angular/JavaScript + SQL/NoSQL) is a pre-built, open-source tech stack that helps developers start fast 
a **rapid-application-development (RAD)** toolkit for building full-stack web apps.

It removes the pain of wiring up the **frontend, backend, and databases**, giving you a ready-to-run foundation built on:
- **Java / Helidon** for backend microservices  
- **Angular / JavaScript** for the frontend  
- **SQL or NoSQL** for persistence  

Focus on building features, not boilerplate. JAQ Stack handles the integration so your team can move from idea to prototype in **days, not weeks**.
